Design thinking is a creative problem-solving approach that can be applied to
designing an air quality monitoring system. Here's a simplified design thinking process
tailored to this task:
1. Empathize:
• Understand the needs and concerns of potential users, such as individuals,
communities, or organizations.
• Conduct interviews, surveys, and research to gather insights into air quality
issues and user preferences.
2. Define:
• Clearly define the problem and set specific goals for the monitoring system.
• Create user personas and scenarios to illustrate who will use the system and
in what contexts.
• Identify key challenges and constraints, such as budget limitations or technical
requirements.
3. Ideate:
• Brainstorm creative solutions for the air quality monitoring system.
• Encourage diverse perspectives from a cross-functional team.
• Explore different concepts, such as portable sensors, real-time data
visualization, or community engagement features.
4. Prototype:
• Build a low-fidelity prototype of the monitoring system. This could be a paper
sketch, a digital mockup, or a simple working model.
• Test the prototype with potential users to gather feedback on usability and
functionality.
• Iterate on the design based on user feedback and insights.
5. Test:
• Develop a more advanced prototype or a pilot version of the monitoring
system.
• Conduct user testing in real-world environments to assess its performance
and usability.
• Gather feedback and data on how well the system meets users' needs.
6. Implement:
• Based on the feedback and insights gathered during testing, refine the design
and create a production-ready version of the system.
• Collaborate with engineers, developers, and manufacturers to bring the
system to life.
• Ensure it meets quality standards and safety regulations.
7. Evaluate:
• Continuously monitor the air quality monitoring system's performance and
gather user feedback after it's deployed.
• Make improvements and updates based on user experiences and emerging
technologies.
• Measure the system's impact on improving air quality awareness and taking
appropriate actions.
8. Iterate:
• Design thinking is an iterative process. Use the insights gained from ongoing
evaluations to refine and enhance the system over time.

PHASE 2 - INNOVATION 
The creation and innovation of air quality monitoring systems have evolved
significantly over the years. Initially, air quality monitoring involved manual
sampling and analysis of air pollutants, but technological advancements have
revolutionized this field.
Key developments include:
 Sensor Technology:
Miniaturized and cost-effective air quality sensors have been developed,
allowing for real-time monitoring of various pollutants, such as particulate
matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and gases like nitrogen
dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3).
 IoT Integration:
These sensors are often connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) platforms,
enabling remote data collection, analysis, and reporting. This connectivity
enhances the accessibility of air quality information.
 Mobile Apps and Websites:
Many air quality monitoring systems offer user-friendly mobile apps and
websites that provide real-time air quality data, historical trends, and health advisories. These tools empower individuals to make informed decisions
about outdoor activities.
 Data Analytics:
Advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms are used to
interpret and predict air quality patterns. This helps authorities and
researchers identify pollution sources and formulate effective mitigation
strategies.
 Wearable Devices:
Innovations in wearable technology have led to the development of
personal air quality monitors that individuals can carry with them. These
devices provide real-time exposure information, promoting personal health awarness
 Air Quality Index (AQI):
The introduction of standardized AQI systems simplifies the communication
of air quality information to the public. It categorizes air quality into easyto-understand levels, making it more accessible to a wider audience.
 Environmental Regulations:
The innovation of air quality monitoring systems has been driven by the
need to comply with environmental regulations and standards.
Governments and organizations are increasingly investing inadvanced
monitoring infrastructure.
 Satellite and Remote Sensing:
Satellite technology and remote sensing techniques play a crucial role in
monitoring air quality on a regional or global scale. These tools provide
valuable data for understanding long-term trends and global air quality patterns.
 Crowdsourced Data:
Citizen science initiatives and crowdsourced data collection apps allow
individuals to contribute air quality measurements, expanding the coverage
of monitoring networks.
Innovations in air quality monitoring systems continue to evolve, driven by thegrowing awareness of the health impacts of air pollution and the need for
accurate, real-time information to support public health and environmental policies
        PHASE 3 - PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
Developing an air quality monitoring project using Tinkercad is a great way to learn
about environmental monitoring and IoT (Internet of Things) applications.. Here's a stepby-step guide to creating an air quality monitoring project using Tinkercad:
COMPONENTS :
1. Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
2. Gas sensors (e.g., MQ series for CO2, CO, or other gases)
3. DHT22 or DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
4. Breadboard and jumper wires
5. Display (LCD or LED) or a computer screen for data visualization
6. A Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266) for wireless data transmission (optional)
PROCEDURE :
1. Set up Tinkercad :
 Create an account on Tinkercad if you don't have one.
 Start a new circuit project.
2. Design the Circuit :
 Add the Arduino board to your circuit.
 Connect the gas sensors and DHT22/DHT11 sensor to the Arduino using
jumper wires.
 If you're using a display, add it to the circuit and connectit to the Arduino as
well.
 If you want to implement wireless data transmission, add an ESP8266 module and connect it to the Arduino.
3. Write the Arduino Code :
 Develop an Arduino sketch (code) that reads data from the gas sensors and the
temperature/humidity sensor.
 Calculate air quality index based on the sensor readings.
4. Simulate the Circuit :
 Use Tinkercad's simulation feature to test your circuit and code. Make sure the
sensor readings and displays work as expected.
5. Calibration :
 Calibrate your gas sensors if needed to ensure accurate air quality
measurements. This often involves exposing the sensors to known gas concentrations6. Data Visualization :
 If you are transmitting data to a server, set up a way to visualize the data using
a web interface or dashboard.
7. Testing :
 Test your project thoroughly in the simulation environment to ensure it's functioning correctly.
8. Real-world Implementation :
 Once your project works in the Tinkercad simulation, build the physical circuit
using real components.
 Upload the code to your Arduino board.
 Install the sensors in the desired location to monitor air quality.
9. Monitoring and Maintenance :
 Regularly monitor and maintain your air quality monitoring system.
 Address any issues or recalibrate sensors if necessary.
